# AWS Lambda Function for Web Scraping and Data Storage

**Project Overview**

This repository hosts the codebase for an AWS Lambda function designed to scrape data from the web and store it in an Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS) instance. This Lambda function is part of a larger data processing and storage system. It efficiently collects data from various online sources and ensures its safe storage for future analysis.

**Features**

- **Web Scraping**: Utilizes web scraping techniques to extract data from designated websites.
- **Data Transformation**: Cleans and transforms raw web data into structured information.
- **Relational Database Storage**: Stores the structured data in an Amazon RDS instance for easy retrieval and querying.
- **Serverless Architecture**: Runs on AWS Lambda, providing a cost-effective and scalable solution.
- **Event-Driven**: Triggers data collection and storage based on predefined events, such as scheduled times or data availability.

**Technologies Used**

- **AWS Lambda**: Serverless compute service that executes code in response to events.
- **Amazon RDS**: Managed relational database service for efficient data storage.
- **Python**: Programming language used for web scraping and data processing.
- **EventBridge**: AWS service for managing event-driven workflows.
- **AWS CloudWatch**: Monitors Lambda function execution and logs.
- **AWS IAM**: Manages permissions and security for AWS resources.

**How It Works**

1. **Web Scraping**: The Lambda function is triggered based on predefined events, such as a scheduled time or the availability of new data on a website.

2. **Data Collection**: Using web scraping techniques, the Lambda function collects data from designated websites. This data is typically in HTML or JSON format.

3. **Data Transformation**: The raw data is processed, cleaned, and transformed into a structured format suitable for storage in a relational database.

4. **Database Storage**: The transformed data is then stored in an Amazon RDS instance, where it can be efficiently queried and analyzed.

5. **Logging and Monitoring**: AWS CloudWatch logs capture execution details, while EventBridge ensures timely event triggering.

**Usage**

This Lambda function can be integrated into various data collection and processing pipelines. It provides a flexible and scalable solution for automating the retrieval and storage of data from the web.
